0.  BMP has 1 bit-2 colors, 2 bit-4 colors, 4 bit-16 colors, 8 bit-256 colors, 16 bit-2^16 colors, 24 bit=2^24 colors, 32bit-2^32 colors.
    GIF is 8 bit so 256 colors possible.JPEG is 24 bit, so 2^24 colors are possible.PNG is 32 bit(24 bit for colors and 8 bit for alpha/transparency), which means 2^24 colors possibility. 
    
1.  GIF

2.  Lossless Compression- Recreates a compressed file as an identical match to the original file.
    Lossy Compression - eliminates repeated or "unnecessary" pieces of data. 
    
3.  JPEG

4.  When the operating system erases a FAT ﬁle, two things occur. 
    First, the system modiﬁes the ﬁlename’s ﬁrst character in the ﬁle’s directory entry to signal that the ﬁle 
    has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled. Second, the system moves all of the ﬁle’s 
    FAT clusters to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. The actual ﬁle data is never touched.
    
5.  Overwriting the drive’s data so that it cannot be recovered.


6.  The <stdint.h> header shall declare sets of integer types having specified widths, and shall define corresponding 
    sets of macros. It shall also define macros that specify limits of integer types corresponding to types defined in 
    other standard headers.
    
7.  Use those predefined type for specific number usage.

8.  BYTE = 8 bit.
    DWORD = 32 bit 
    LONG = 32 bit
    WORD = 16 bit 


9.  The first 2 bytes of any BMP file is the bfType. It must be set to character B and M to indicate the bitmap.


10. bfSize specifies the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
	biSize specifies the size of the structure in bytes.
	
	
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap)
	and its origin is the upper left corner.
	
	
12. biBitCount Specifies the number of bits per pixel.
	
	
13. Not enough disk space, no authoritation to creat file, etc.


14. Since there will be only 1 BITMAPINFOHEADER inside a bmp, the fread should only read 1 set of sizeof(BITMAPFILEHEADER).

15. 1


16. fseek(inptr, padding, SEEK_CUR);
    The fseek() function sets the file position indicator for the inptr pointed to by inptr. 
    The new position, measured in bytes, is obtained by adding padding bytes to the position.
    
    
17. SEEK_CUR moves the pointer x bytes down from the current pointer position.
